                    <p>This route offers a number of options to access beaches south of Arklow.
                        The most rewarding is the path through the quarry, leading to a hiking trail to the peak of
                        'Arklow Rock'. This involves crossing through a working quarry so care must be taken,
                        particularly during working hours Mon - Sat, so it is less suitable for young children or dogs
                        off-leash.
                        Parking is available at the harbour, or 1km further at the 'cove': a small, sandy, sheltered
                        swimming beach just below the quarry. If parking at the cove, approach via the road adjoining
                        Arklow South beach/ golf course; the gravel road to the left of the quarry gates reveals a large
                        gravelled parking area</p>
                    <p>The full trail crosses through the quarry area to an path which traverses the quarry road uphill.
                        To your left you pass the 'grotto' a Marian tribute which is festooned with tributes and relics
                        in honour of StBrigid. Approx 1km further along you reach the outer quarry gates, at this point
                        you turn left and cross through a stile up towards a gravel track. This proceeds for approx
                        0.5km uphill, from this point on are fantastic coastal views across Wexford and Wicklow. Follow
                        the track around, progressing downhill, to reach the level gravel paths linking the cove to
                        Nun's beach to the south.<br>

                                throught
                                the Quarry and then around the rock. Good footwear is a must. we stopped a few times to
                                take
                                in the views and chat you can drive up to the beach at the end and go for a swim!!

                    <p>Take a walk on Arklow Riverwalk, alongside the wide and meandering Avoca River, which flows
                        through Arklow’s town centre.
                        A 3km gentle Riverwalk loop begins from the edge of the 19 Arches Bridge and The Bridge Hotel.
                        Follow the river on a journey inland under the enormous weeping willows which tip the water’s
                        surface in places.
                        Look out for wildlife - you'll see swans, geese, squirrels, even ponies and the occasional otter
                        along the way!
                        Pass by the remains of the Ormond Castle, of which only a fragment remains, having been totally
                        destroyed by Oliver Cromwell's army after an attack in 1649.
                        Dotted along the walk are several hand-carved wooden sculptures depicting native animals,
                        created by local artist Richard White.

                            but the river views and the swans and other wildlife were truly spectacular</i></p>

                    <p>Scenic forestry trail with good gravel paths, there are also several wider loops within Glenart.
                        Glenart Wood is situated to the south of the Avoca River and access is just 1.5km from Arklow
                        Town centre.
                        The Glenart Estate dates from the Norman invasion when Theobald Walter, from whom the Butlers
                        and the Dukes of Ormond are descended, was granted large tract of lands in County Wicklow.
                        Glenart Castle, which is now privately owned, remains and you will catch glimpses of it through
                        the woodlands."
                    </p>
                    <p>Glenart Woods are nestled in a small glen with streams flowing through it into the Avoca River,
                        making for a pleasant and tranquil 5km looped walk.
                        Walking clockwise around the loop you quickly reach another forest road on your right.
                        Continue straight for approximately 150m and you reach a junction that leads to the "stone
                        bridge" on the left.
                        A slight diversion from the loop across the stone bridge affords views over Arklow and the
                        coast.
                        Back on the loop walk bear right at the stone bridge as you progress along the southern side of
                        the wood.
                        A quarry is on your right and 300m further on you turn right at a junction.
                        A further 500m, the road bends to the right as you continue along the northern side of the walk.
                        The loop is completed at the footbridge and walkers leave the site by retreating down the forest
                        road on the left to the forest barrier.</p>

                            continue to support walkers.
                            The tracks are well maintained and offer a range of challenging walks or runs, with mild
                            uphills for variety.

                    <p>The Arklow Nature and Wildlife Reserve nestles beneath the North Coastal Walk on Arklow’s north
                        shore. The small lake which forms the centrepiece of the reserve started life as a boating lake
                        in 1958
                        and is affectionately known locally as ‘the duck pond’. The lake is now a wildlife sanctuary
                        made up of several diverse habitats,
                        home to many water bird species such as ducks, geese, swans, grebes, and gulls</p>
                    <p>There is a viewing deck on either side of the lake, which are good for bird feeding and photo
                        opportunities.
                        encourages visitors to view the birds up close. The reeds provides shelter and nest sites for
                        the Moorhen, Little Grebe, Mallard Ducks, Geese and Swans.
                        Around the Lake is a 2km trail suitable for walkers and joggers. This path adjoins the Arklow
                        Bay Hotel and gardens, and provides a pleasant stop-off
                        to enjoy refreshments on the lawns that meet the edge of the walking trail.
                        The adjacent Kynock’s Park and Coastal Walk are a nice addition to your ramble in this area.
                        The Playground, Skatepark, Dementia Friendly Garden and Coral Leisure Centre and Pool are also
                        adjacent.

                    <p><i>The duckpond is a fantastic walk for all the family. Well maintained tarmac paths circle the
                            lake, with viewing access points along the route.
                            Crossing the rock armour to the caravan park leads to some interesting, quiet beaches for
                            fishing or swimming </i></p>

                    <p>This is a forest trail, the first half a lane through mixed woodland and the second part along
                        quiet roads.
                        About 3km along the route a pyramid is revealed, this forms part of the ancient Howard
                        graveyard. The pyramid itself is photogenic and the views over the fields of the Arklow valley
                        towards the town are spectacular.
                        This is a lovely walk for all the family.</p>
                    <p>Parking is available at the entrance to Kilbride woods for up to 6 cars.
                        Kinsellas Country Market shop provides an opportunity for ice cream at either end of the
                        journey.</p>

                    <p><i>This walk is pleasant, a good walk for all the family as, while the road through the forest is
                            used by locals to access their homes,
                            it is generally quiet and peaceful, surrounded by lovely native Irish trees. We have spotted
                            rabbits, foxes and deer along the forest track.
                            What a surprise to encounter a pyramid along the route, the kids loved it...

                    <p>This trail from the Tesco car park takes you along the urban centre (Wexford Road) towards the
                        outskirts of Arklow. Turn left at the roundabout after the bus stop, about 1km along.
                        Follow this road to the end, passing The Maples housing estate to the left hand side, then take
                        a right turn at the railway crossing, and head towards Moneylands Farm.
                        This takes you along a remarkably undeveloped route with wonderful coastal views towards the
                        farm which includes the 'Broken Chair' cafe.
                        Suitable for solo walkers and family during daylight hours, gates to Moneylands farm close
                        overnight</p>
                    <p>Reasonably safe walk with spectacular sea views when approaching Moneylands Farm. The last 1.5km
                        is on a narrow road so beware of traffic. The Broken Chair cafe and motorhome park are within
                        the grounds of Moneylands farm. The cafe is open for breakfast and lunch (booking advisable)
