## About
This website highlights jogging, hiking and walking trails available in the Arklow, Co. Wicklow area of Ireland.  It is designed for recreational runners and walkers, which may include tourists (First-time and Returning site visitors), and local people (typcially Returning site visitors).   
The website is hosted by the Arklow Trail Trotters, an informal group who meet twice weekly and run or walk between 5 - 10km, using the trails listed here.  The site is intended to raise awareness of Arklow's community walking routes, to highlight the natural and urban landscape of Arklow, and, as a tourism aid, to showcase some of the pleasant and interesting features within Arklow Town.  Site visitors are invited to informally participate with the Arklow Trail Trotters if they The provision of gallery images makes the user aware of the attractiveness and features of each walk.   Visitors are made aware of, and invited to participate in, the informal Trail Trotter runs/ walks.

## Project Goals
To produce a user-friendly, informative website of walks in the Arklow geographical area.
### Strategy
The aim is to increase the 'brand awareness' of Arklow as an active tourism destination.
It it an offshoot of the Wicklow Tourism website.
The audience is:
a. Tourists visiting the Arklow region,  and who wish to explore the area on foot
b. Arklow residents who wish to explore the area and familiarise themselves with local history
Note that both these groups may have varying mobility capabilities, and therefore it is important to flag if certain routes are wheelchair/ pushchair friendly.
c. Groups on school tours or day outings who are seeking guided walks 

Existing walking guides include:<br>
https://www.alltrails.com/ireland/county-wicklow/arklow <br>
https://www.visitarklow.ie/nature-outdoors/walks

The existing sites do not include the full range of walks available, and don't consistently include actual route maps and parking information.

### Target Audience
* The target audience includes visitors to, and residents of, Arklow who seek running/walking route information
* The target audience includes recreational joggers and walkers, singly or in groups.
* Runners are a particular target audience, and would like to know route difficulty level?
* Family groups are a particular target audience, perhaps including mobility challenges - suitability for pushchairs/wheelchairs
* Dog walkers?
* The target audience seeks assistance to choose an appropriate walk (terrain, distance, safety, accessibility) for their needs
* The target audience may have an interest in local history and wish to learn more via website links
* The target audience wishes to know about teashops/ bathrooms en route
* NB  The target audience are likely to commence using the site on desktop, but are likely to progress to small-screen use as will use this site when they are 'out and about' to locate the start of the walk relative to their current location, and possibly to cross reference photos against what they see when walking one of the routes, and to add new photos which and increase the bank of knowledge about this walk.  Therefore the primary site usage is expected to be via mobile devices.

## UX Design Decisions
### Wireframes
(link to wireframe images desktop)
(link to wireframe images tablet??)
(link to wireframe images mobile - assuming it is best practice to include a wireframe image for mobile also)

### Fonts Chosen
Libre Franklin and Libre Baskerville are chosen because they are readable on large screens or smaller mobile devices.  This font is recommended for sites that may be content-heavy but which are regarded as fun friendly and approachable/inclusive.
.. these fonts are likely to change as look readable and businesslike, but don't look particularly  friendly or approachable... therefore an improved font would be less formal (sans serif???)

### Colour Scheme
The colour combinations chosen are ...
blue-green, light-blue, ice-cream yellow.... the overall to resemble neapolitan ice cream which is a visual trigger for Arklow as a seaside town. The colours used are non-threatening and feel friendly, familiar and safe, so encouraging to users who may be socially hesitant,  or feel embarassed about their level of fitness, to feel that the Arklow Trail Trotters group is inclusive, friendly and will welcome them.

### Design Imagery
The images chosen is reminicent of .....
ice cream
1970's seaside visits
slightly faded postcard photos ... retro feel to bring people back into safety of childhood.

... to be completed ...

## Testing 
To be completed ...  remember to include a table here which shows user stories/ user requirements and whether each has a pass/fail result (do I need to repeat each test on different device sizes?)
In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your project’s features and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.

### RTM-proof

## Gitpod Reminders

To run a backend Python file, type `python3 app.py`, if your Python file is named `app.py` of course.

A blue button should appear to click: _Make Public_,

Another blue button should appear to click: _Open Browser_.

In Gitpod you have superuser security privileges by default. Therefore you do not need to use the `sudo` (superuser do) command in the bash terminal in any of the lessons.

To log into the Heroku toolbelt CLI:

1. Log in to your Heroku account and go to *Account Settings* in the menu under your avatar.
2. Scroll down to the *API Key* and click *Reveal*
3. Copy the key
4. In Gitpod, from the terminal, run `heroku_config`
5. Paste in your API key when asked

You can now use the `heroku` CLI program - try running `heroku apps` to confirm it works. This API key is unique and private to you so do not share it. If you accidentally make it public then you can create a new one with _Regenerate API Key_.

## FAQ about the uptime script

**Why have you added this script?**

It will help us to calculate how many running workspaces there are at any one time, which greatly helps us with cost and capacity planning. It will help us decide on the future direction of our cloud-based IDE strategy.

**How will this affect me?**

For everyday usage of Gitpod, it doesn’t have any effect at all. The script only captures the following data:

- An ID that is randomly generated each time the workspace is started.
- The current date and time
- The workspace status of “started” or “running”, which is sent every 5 minutes.

It is not possible for us or anyone else to trace the random ID back to an individual, and no personal data is being captured. It will not slow down the workspace or affect your work.

**So….?**

We want to tell you this so that we are being completely transparent about the data we collect and what we do with it.

**Can I opt out?**

Yes, you can. Since no personally identifiable information is being captured, we'd appreciate it if you let the script run; however if you are unhappy with the idea, simply run the following commands from the terminal window after creating the workspace, and this will remove the uptime script:

```
pkill uptime.sh
rm .vscode/uptime.sh
```

**Anything more?**

Yes! We'd strongly encourage you to look at the source code of the `uptime.sh` file so that you know what it's doing. As future software developers, it will be great practice to see how these shell scripts work.

---

Happy coding!
